            text: 'Over time we have straightened, deepened and diverted rivers, sometimes cutting off entire meanders (wiggles). This has historically been done for a number of reasons, for example to allow for navigation by boats.  We all know about terrible issues with water quality, but these modifications are actually the number one reason why rivers are in poor condition across the country.'

            text: ' and one on the Arun. Restoring these meanders allows rivers to function naturally once more, reconnecting them to their floodplain and making them more resilient to drought and flooding.  The river becomes more varied in its flow and form once again. A more natural river is also great for wildlife too. '
