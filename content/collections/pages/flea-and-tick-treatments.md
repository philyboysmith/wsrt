            text: 'New analysis of Environment Agency data by The Rivers Trust and the Wildlife and Countryside Link, shows that three insecticides used widely in tick, flea and worm treatments (fipronil, permethrin and the controversial neonicotinoid imidacloprid) â€“ are present in English rivers in concentrations that exceed accepted safe limits for wildlife. This is despite the fact that these chemicals are deemed to be too toxic to be used in agriculture.'

            text: 'In our rivers, insect larvae, such as mayflies and dragonflies, are particularly vulnerable to the toxic effects of these veterinary chemicals. These species and many others serve as essential food sources for fish, birds, and bats. Therefore, when these pesticides enter our rivers, they disrupt the balance of the entire ecosystem, causing ripple effects that impact the wider environment. '

            text: 'Recent studies indicate that these chemicals are finding their way into rivers from various routes, including contaminated household wastewater from washing treated pets and their clothes and bedding, urinary and faecal excretions, and allowing treated dogs to swim in rivers. The result is a steady flow of harmful pesticides into our rivers, endangering the delicate balance of life within them.'
