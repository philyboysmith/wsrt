            text: 'A ‘consented discharge’ allows waste from water companies, agriculture, industries and homes to be put into the river. We all know about the stink from sewage overflows, but incredibly over 700 of these consented discharges are actually from homes with small private sewage treatment plants and septic tanks. If they are not well maintained our rivers are at risk.'
