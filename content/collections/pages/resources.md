        text: |-
          Knowing how to tackle the many different types of invasive non-native species can be tricky. 

          We worked with the South Downs National Park Authority to produce some factsheets giving helpful advice on some of the main INNS found here in the south-east. With helpful tips on how to identify, treat and stop INNS from reappearing we hope these guides help you.

          Once a common sight along our waterways, water voles have rapidly disappeared from much of the landscape, experiencing one of the most serious declines of any British mammal over the last century.

          However, simple improvements to land management practices can enhance the suitability of habitat for water voles, helping to connect colonies across the landscape.
