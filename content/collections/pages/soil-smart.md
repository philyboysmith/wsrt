When this happens over soil, the rain can take the soil and all sorts of pollutants and chemicals with it and straight into the rivers. The extra soil in the water can make the water murky and can smother marine creatures. "

So far, we have evaluated the most important soil metrics to measure and developed a Soil SmARt Toolkit which contains the tests; pH, water infiltration, visual evaluation of soil structure (VESS), soil texture (jar and hand texturing), Solvita soil respiration, earthworm counts, soil nutrients, bury your undies, and a slake test.
