This will be a collaborative project and will involve working closely with our project partners and the farmers. Together we will design a soil health monitoring scheme that will use easy and low-cost tests that can be done in the field by the farmers or volunteers. This will enable the farmers to test their soils anytime they want and to gain greater knowledge of soil health. This will also help us to have a better understanding of the health of local soils and what we can do to help improve them.'

We would also like to engage more with non-farmers in the area to promote better understanding of soils and their importance, and hope to focus on urban areas and private gardens/allotments in the future.'

Soil also grows the plants that are the habitats or food source of many other species. One teaspoon of healthy soil can have 10 billion organisms in it! '

When this happens over soil, the rain can take the soil and all sorts of pollutants with it and straight into the rivers. The extra soil in the water can make the soil murky and can smother the creatures living in the water and contributes to the loss of valuable topsoil through soil erosion. "
