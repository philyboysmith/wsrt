            text: "Soil SmARt is a part of a larger project called CaSTCo (link to CaSTCo page), an innovation project focused on uniting the different organisations involved in river health in the UK. As part of CaSTCo we are able to be a trial area for different soil monitoring methods. We aim to put this opportunity to good use by running a variety of different programs over the next year and a half. This project focuses on the Western Rother and the River Arun catchments.\_"

            text: 'Our first project is working with 5 farmers across the catchment to monitor the health of their soils. This will be a collaborative project and will involve working closely with our project partners and the farmers. Together we will design a soil health monitoring scheme that will use easy and low-cost tests that can be done in the field by the farmers or volunteers. This will enable the farmers to test their soils anytime they want and to gain greater knowledge of soil health. This will also help us to have a better understanding of the health of local soils and what we can do to help improve them.'

We would also like to engage more with non-farmers in the area to promote better understanding of soils and their importance, and hope to focus on urban areas and private gardens/allotments in the future.'

            text: 'Soils are the foundation for life on earth and they provide many benefits to the world around us. Food grown in soils provides around 98% of all the calories humans consume. Soils are also a valuable habitat for all sorts of organisms â€“ by some estimates more than half of all terrestrial species live in the soil! Soil also grows the plants that are the habitats or food source of many other species. One teaspoon of healthy soil can have 10 billion organisms in it! Soils can also help to fight climate change; this is because they can store carbon. In fact, soils store more carbon than all the trees and plants, and the atmosphere combined! Furthermore, healthy soils can help prevent or reduce flooding as they can absorb water and slowly release the water into the rivers, instead of all the water entering the rivers at once. So, it is vital that we look after our soils, unfortunately, our soils are under threat. Some land management practices mean that soils are being sealed (covered with concrete), soil is being eroded and degraded, and carbon is being lost from soils. With this project we aim to increase understanding of the importance of good soil health and promote the improvement of soils in the local area!'

            text: "You might be wondering what the link between soil health and water quality is. The truth is that they are very connected to each other. When it rains, the rainwater can run over the earth's surface and into the nearby waterbodies, this is known as run off. When this happens over soil, the rain can take the soil and all sorts of pollutants with it and straight into the rivers. The extra soil in the water can make the soil murky and can smother the creatures living in the water and contributes to the loss of valuable topsoil through soil erosion. The runoff can also take chemicals like nitrogen and phosphorus, which are used on the fields, into the water which can be harmful to the rivers. Healthy soils, however, can help to improve water quality, as they are able to stick together better, reducing erosion and pollution, and can improve water infiltration, reducing water runoff. In our area 67% of waterbodies are being impacted by pollution from agriculture and the river rother is the most erodible catchment in the UK. This is why it is so important for us as a Rivers Trust to have a strong focus on soils, and this is why the Soil SmARt project will be looking into local soil health."
