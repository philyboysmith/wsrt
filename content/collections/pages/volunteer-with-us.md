    text: |-
      ARRT are supplying water quality testing kits (measuring Phosphates, Turbidity, Total Dissolved Solids and Nitrates) and corresponding training to ARRT volunteers to create a continuous water quality testing cooperative.

      Increasing monitoring across our catchment (spatially and temporally), which currently has zero waterbodies achieving the acceptable standard met by the Water Framework Directive (WFD).

      We aim to cover the entire catchment and collaborate with groups and orgs who currently or previously collected water quality and river health data. The 'ARRT Water Quality Survey' looks at river characteristics, ecosystems, wildlife, and pollution alongside chemical readings, to provide a holistic view of river health at every site.

    text: |-
      Riverfly monitoring is a national citizen science project that trains volunteers to monitor Riverflies (aquatic invertebrates) as an indication of water quality.
      Volunteers receive training with us and then join a team of like-minded individuals to sample a local spot on the river each month.
      The data collected from the scheme helps us understand the health of our rivers, and highlights when there may be a more serious problem to address.
