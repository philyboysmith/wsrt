            text: "Winding its way through rolling English countryside, the River Arun is the longest river (60 kms) to sit entirely within Sussex. Starting in St Leonards Forest as a series of small streams called ghylls (or gills), the Arun runs, for a short time, eastwards to Horsham, but its main section runs southwards through the South Downs National Park to its mouth at Littlehampton where it flows into the English Channel.\_"

Once known as the ‘Trisantonis’ in Roman times, roughly translating to ‘the wanderer’ probably due to the river meandering across the landscape, the Arun was once used to transport goods by boat.\_\_"

This would have been transported by river boats all the way to Littlehampton quay to be transferred to coastal vessels for transit across the sea, or along the coast.\_"

            text: "In the Lower Arun you’ll find an important wetland site – the freshwater wetlands at Pulborough, Amberley and Waltham Brooks. This area is rich in native flora, marshes, ditches, lowland bog, and invertebrates including the rare Ramshorn snail. A plethora of wildfowl and wading birds flock here in the winter, including Berwick swans. All year round there are a variety of birds to spot so definitely pack your binoculars if you’re heading here for a summer stroll.\_"

            text: "In the upper reaches of the Arun near Horsham, the river played an important role in the iron industry from 1540 to around 1630. Hammer ponds were made by damming the river to form ponds to cool molten iron, while diverted streams from these ponds were used to drive water wheels for bellows and forging hammers.\_"
