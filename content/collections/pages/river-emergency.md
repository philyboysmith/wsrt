            text: "The Rother has the dubious accolade of being the most erodible catchment in the UK. Here the sandy soils are easily washed into the river during rainfall. Soil in the river is known as sediment. It affects water quality and smothers gravels and plants.\_ Fish can’t lay their eggs in gravels which are smothered by sediment."

            text: "Straightening rivers and forcing them into man-made channels prevents them from behaving naturally. Luna Leopold also said ‘The stream has to have change’. Our rivers need to be free to grow and shrink, shift and sway. They should be sinuous, meandering here and there in braided multi-channels. Rivers and floodplains should be one in the same entity. Our desire to control rivers is often at our peril - we see more frequent and severe flooding events downstream where rivers are constrained. Where there’s space to do so we need to re-wet the landscape, allowing nature to do its thing.\_ There are so many benefits for us too."

Around 30,000 properties in our area are at risk of flooding from this type of ‘surface water’.\_"
