<p>ARRT invites volunteers to undertake river monitoring to get to know their rivers better and aid future improvements and enjoyment. The Trust is investing in citizen science through the River Fly Partnership, working in partnership with the South Downs National Park, training local people to monitor river based invertebrates that act as important indicators of river health.</p>
