We see pollution incidents and decreasing water quality, as underperforming wastewater treatment works discharge gallons and gallons of sewage out into our rivers. Often the treatment works just don’t have the capacity to treat all the water they receive, especially as we develop ever more houses.\_ But the crazy thing here is that water companies are not a statutory consultee on development - they don’t have a say on where, when and how many homes are developed – the new development must be connected to their network and they must deal with all the resulting sewage."

The Commission believes that water companies should be included within a ‘requirement to assist’ with the development of those Local Plans. The Commission believes water companies should have a clear ability to comment on planning applications above a certain threshold in England. The UK Government should consider whether this should be as a statutory consultee, or through a ‘requirement to notify.’ This is to ensure water companies can deploy site specific technical advice and avoid delays. Finally, the UK government should conduct a review of the ‘right to connect.’ This obliges water companies to connect new domestic water supplies upon request, regardless of network capacity and any lack of advanced notice. The UK government should undertake an assessment of whether it is appropriate to provide for circumstances where a water company can object to a request, for example, when there is insufficient network capacity.’'
