            text: "I've come from Adur & Worthing Councils Sustainability Team where I developed a wide range of nature recovery projects, policy and partnerships. I loved working on the Adur River Recovery Project alongside multiple partners and landowners to revive and enhance the river Adur. It got me hooked on river restoration! Prior to that I worked in various project manager roles focussing on sustainable food and farming, which included the development of partnership action plans to transform behaviour, policy and land use.\_"

I'll be collaborating with core partners (South Downs National Park Authority, South Downs Trust, Southern Water and Chichester District Council) and wider stakeholders to develop an action plan for restoration of the Western Rother that flows through the National Park - the emphasis here being on action, rather than just a plan that sits on a shelf.

This collective action will help to restore natural processes, improve water quality and soil health as well as see the recovery of key species - hello water voles!\_There is already a range of inspiring work underway, but there's so much more to do to ensure the Rother is a river worthy of a National Park.\_"

I've had a range of excellent site visits to Leconfield Estate and Woolbeding Estate to discover the inspiring range of river and flood-plain restoration work that is already going on, and to see the impacts that structures, like weirs, have on the river.

This was followed by a 'have a go' fly fishing session in the Rother - which included a magical sunset, a huge full moon and a barn owl fly-by, so it was a really special evening and a great start to working at the Trust - thanks all!\_"

            text: "I always wanted to return back to my nature roots since studying Ecology & Conservation at university. Over the last few years I've worked on a range of projects with the Ouse & Adur Rivers Trust. They inspired me to understand more about wetland habitats and the huge range of benefits they bring. So recently I delved deeper into the wonders of wetlands via the Wetlands Health & Vitality Foundation Course with WWT.\_Earlier this year, I saw a video of the River Rother Summit which took place in November 23. I remember thinking what a great project that would be...and then a few months later, the job came up! My growing fascination and knowledge for wetlands, coupled with my extensive experience developing and leading projects, partnerships and funding bids meant it just felt like the perfect role for me.\_"

So lots to do - that will be the main challenge, but also lots of opportunities and lots of commitment and support for restoring this wonderful river."

I was amazed to see an Osprey hunting on the Adur Estuary near where I live. I'm hoping to spot lots of wildlife on the Rother... Otter is high on my list and Water Vole too...but having increased my knowledge an interest in fish at our team learning session recently, I'd also like to see a Wild Trout and other key fish species that inhabit the river.\_"

I'm a bit of a salty seabird and love the connection between river and sea, spending most days out walking a loop of the estuary and beach at Shoreham-by-sea...so many changes throughout tide times and seasons, I never get bored of it. We're fairly regular visitors to Wales and stay near the River Teifi near Cenarth where there are clear pools, meandering bends and flowing falls, all perfect for chilly paddling and spotting wildlife - yet to spot a salmon though.\_"
