After that my husband and I had several outdoor pursuit stores ourselves in West Sussex. I then took time out to have my three children and decided to train as a Primary school Teacher. I worked for several years in a variety of schools and as the Forest School movement took off in the U.K I trained as a Forest School Leader as well.\_\_"

Through my educational and Forest School experience, I know that some children are lacking in resilience and give up easily. Therefore, we need to be creating a supportive environment, teaching emotional literacy and regulation.'
