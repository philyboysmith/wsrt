<p><strong>Improving and Protecting the Aldingbourne Rife </strong></p>
<p>The Aldingbourne Rife is a vitally important wildlife corridor that connects the South Downs National Park to the Chichester<br />
Coastal Plain, providing a habitat for many rare species and enables wildlife to move and migrate.</p>
<p>The focus on the Aldingbourne Rife will be on one of its key species, European eels and we would like to engage with local people on monitoring this vitally important water course.</p>
