Adding wildlife cutouts there were some great discussions around what a riverscape is and what makes one healthy, or not so healthy. This activity was a great hit and a useful visual aid to help learn about how the surrounding landscape and our actions as humans, can all affect the health of our local rivers.\_\_"

            text: "With soil being a hot topic and vital to the health of any riverscape, the WSRT team helped visitors understand what makes soil healthy. A popular talking point was the “bury your undies” demo, which showcased how a healthy soil has microbes in it\_ - the healthier the soil the more microbes are contained within it and so the undies (cloth) will degrade faster. Another great visual which many people were able to clearly understand and learn from.\_"

The Lavant is a chalk stream and a winterbourne so it is extra special and we want the river to be enjoyed for many generations to come and provide a fantastic home for wildlife. It’s great to see the river being an integral part of village life and with the help and support of communities, and the work of our River Guardians, we will be able to improve the health and resilience of the Lavant and protect it for future years.” \_"

Ranunculus, so much more than in previous years, floating and swerving as I pass by. Clusters of hemlock, as sentinels along the river bank. And the paradox, hemlock swaddling new life, protecting a nest full of eggs from any dangers nearby. A precious stream? Certainly!”'
