            text: 'Every incidence of sewage pollution in our rivers and streams is unacceptable. When it occurs in a relatively small stream with a modest flow of water the impact can be most significant. Add to this that the Lavant is one of less than 300 precious chalk streams on Earth, and the tragedy is even more stark.'
