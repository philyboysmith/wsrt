For six years I had the pleasure of working across the length and breadth of the South East with many different volunteers and on various citizen science projects such as microplastics, beach cleans and the Big Seaweed Search. Most recently I was involved with a domestic retrofitting project reducing carbon and energy use in homes.'

            text: "I am super pleased to be part of the WSRT team. My role will cover the Aldingbourne rife and Lavant river and I’ll be looking at how I can help interested parties and landowners to improve and restore these waterbodies. Chalk streams are incredibly rare, valuable\_ and beautiful habitats, and we’re very lucky to have 85% of them in England. Along with the Rivers Trust team I will be promoting the importance of water quality and monitoring, surveying and sampling, as well as removing barriers and re-naturalising the rivers."

It’s been great to get out on the ground straightaway and see stretches of the Aldingbourne and the Lavant and this is just the start. I’ve been introduced to some amazing people already and I have lots of meetings and site walks planned before Christmas to get myself as prepared as possible for the coming months.'

There are some great opportunities for restoring the Lavant and Aldingbourne back to better health and I am keen to work very closely with stakeholders and partners to realise a better future for the river and for the communities living next to it.'

We went to Piddletrenthide and I remember walking up the river Piddle, barefooted, thoroughly excited by the stony riverbed under my toes, seeing young fish darting all around, running my fingers through the beds of river weed and seeing the dappling of light and shade created by the trees overhead. It was a long lasting magical moment and I’ve treasured those memories and that experience ever since.'
