<p>A ‘monster’ Barbel has been landed in <a href="http://sussexangling.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Petworth and Bognor Angling Club</a>’s waters by member Colin Smithson, breaking the 13 year old British record.</p>
<p>Colin thought he had hooked a big Mirror Carp says club representative Steve Penticost but after a terrific fight was amazed to see the giant Barbel surface.</p>
<p>Dedicating this 21lb 2oz record breaker to brother Roy, who sadly passed away at just 63, Colin said 'I’m sure Roy was looking down on me and I know, as a keen angler himself, would have been immensely proud to see me catch this fish’</p>
<p>Trustees of the Arun &amp; Rother Rivers Trust were particularly pleased to hear of his catch in their waters because, as Chairman Charlie Baker points out, Barbel need well oxygenated clean water to survive and breed. It says we’re making progress!</p>
