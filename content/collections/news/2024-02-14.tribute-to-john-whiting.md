John was a Trustee of ARRT for over a decade, his hard work, expertise and enthusiasm for the rivers of Sussex has been greatly valued. John was a committed Trustee and a good friend to many at ARRT, he will be dearly missed. On behalf of all who knew and worked with John, we wish to extend our sincere condolences to John’s family.</p>
