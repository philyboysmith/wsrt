            text: 'This funding comes at a time when rivers and wetlands are under increasing threat from climate change, water usage, pollution, flooding, drought, and fragmentation. Some two thirds of all freshwater species are supported by ponds and yet the UK has lost half of all its ponds since 1900. In the South Downs National Park, a survey of pond locations showed that almost 70 per cent are in poor condition, or have disappeared from the landscape, resulting in large swathes of downland where no water is available for wildlife.'

That’s why we’re pleased to fund South Downs National Park Trust to deliver this project that will not only restore vital wetlands and ponds, but bring more people to appreciate and care for their waterways. At The National Lottery Heritage Fund, we’re incredibly proud to be playing a role in ensuring our natural heritage is safeguarded for generations to come, but also that the projects we fund give people the chance to connect with the nature and wildlife that is on their doorsteps.”'
