<p>Barnham Primary School’s Eco Team joined up with environmental charity, the Arun &amp; Rother Rivers Trust (ARRT) to raise nearly £2,000 towards its river protection programme.</p>
<p>The money comes from the Co-op Community Fund which selects local projects to receive a donation from members every time they shop.</p>
<p>“Our goal,” said ARRT Trustee Richard Hammond [pictured with one of Barnham Primary’s ‘eco warriors’ receiving a large cheque from the Co-op] “is to stop people polluting local streams by pouring oil, paint or cement washings into our drains.”</p>
<p>Together Barnham Primary School and ARRT volunteers painted Yellow Fishes on the kerb close to road drains starting at the school entrance and running along Orchard Way right up to the local stream, Barnham Rife.</p>

En route it does immeasurable damage to plants, fish and wildlife.”</p>
<p>The <a href="http://arrt.org.uk">Arun &amp; Rother Rivers Trust</a>  based in the South Downs National Park works right across West Sussex to improve, care for and enhance our rivers and streams protecting them for future generations.</p>
