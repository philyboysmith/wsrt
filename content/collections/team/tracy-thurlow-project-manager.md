Tracy has lived in West Sussex most of her life and spent many hours outdoors exploring the Sussex coast where she was brought up. After studying Energy Resources & the Environment at University, she worked at the Environment Agency for 17 years before joining the Rivers Trust. She has a love of nature and the outdoors and has had the enormous pleasure of helping the Trust grow over the last 10 years and is excited to see what impact the growing team can have on the rivers of Western Sussex.
