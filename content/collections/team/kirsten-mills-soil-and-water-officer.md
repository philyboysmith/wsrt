Brought up in the Norfolk Broads, Kirsten has been around rivers most of her childhood. Following her passion for the natural world she studied environmental science in Bangor, North Wales and in Wageningen, The Netherlands. As WSRTâ€™s Soil and Water Officer she is keen to put into practice what she has learnt. Kirsten is looking forward to working with volunteers and stakeholders, and to help bring positive change to the local area.
