Growing up in West Sussex Sam always enjoyed spending time in, on, or by the water. After studying at Chichester college she then spent many years as an outdoor education instructor. When Sam moved to The Cotswolds she noticed the poor health of the River Evenlode. After learning the reasons for its decline, Sam has spent the past few years engaging with local communities to educate them on the issues and inspire them to help return their waterways back to a good ecological status. She has experience using various citizen science methods to collect water quality data which can be used to find and evidence pollution sources and push for changes to be made. Sam has now returned to West Sussex and is looking forward to helping protect our riverscapes.
