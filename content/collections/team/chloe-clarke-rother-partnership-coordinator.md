Chloe grew up in Sussex, so knows and loves the local landscapes. She is an experienced programme manager, leading projects and partnerships to bring about changes in policy, behaviour and land use. She has a passion and curiosity for all things nature, and strong roots in communications, conservation and community. Chloe is hugely excited about working collaboratively with partners and stakeholders to bring about positive change for the Western River Rother that flows within the South Downs National Park. She hopes to connect more people to the wonders of wetlands and to keep on learning and spotting as much wildlife as she can!
