Mandy has worked in nature conservation for 16 years, with the National Trust as a Ranger and Project Co-ordinator, managing rare habitats such as ancient woodlands and heathlands for rare species such as Dartford warblers and silver studded blue butterflies. She has always loved the natural world and combining her passion for photography, has travelled to Kenya to see the lions and wildebeest on the Masai Mara, New Zealand for the whales and dolphins and the Galapagos to see the iguanas, giant tortoises, birds and sea lions. Mandy also has a background in IT having worked in the industry for over 20 years. She has a very keen interest in the health of her local rivers as a wild swimmer, kayaker and canoeist and is excited to be part of a team protecting and improving them for nature, wildlife and people.
