Nick lives in a 16th century mill on the river Arun, which flows around and under his home.  Nick recently took on the restoration of the previously silted, stagnant mill pond and restored it to create a thriving habitat for birds, fish, eels and amphibians.  During an international career in business leadership, Nick and his family lived in 10 countries on 4 continents.  Now back in the UK, in addition to starting his own business with a focus on leadership and organisational effectiveness, Nick is keen to support causes aimed at improving the environment and protecting biodiversity.
