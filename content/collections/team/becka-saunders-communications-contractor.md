Becka has worked in communications for the past 15 years, with 13 years experience specifically in the environmental sector. Becka has worked on projects involving a huge range of habitats and different communities, and is now looking forward to focusing on communicating about the world of rivers. Growing up in the stunning South Downs, Becka has a deep rooted love of the outdoors, with some of her favourite childhood (and adult!) memories involving paddling in streams, wild swimming and watching the world go by on riverbanks. With a passion for nature and wildlife, Becka is very excited to be involved with helping spread the WSRT messages far and wide, doing her bit towards helping our precious riverscapes thrive.
