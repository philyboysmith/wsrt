Cathy has a wealth of experience working with schools and young people after a career as a Primary  School teacher and Forest School Leader. She is excited to use these skills in her new role at the Western Sussex Rivers Trust to inspire and engage children with rivers as part of the Downs to the Sea project. She is committed to working with teachers to help young people understand and appreciate their riverscapes and take action to protect them. With a love of the outdoors, rivers and glaciers, Cathy spends her spare time exploring the countryside near home and further afield with Bailey her trusty Cockapoo sidekick.
