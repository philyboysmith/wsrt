Charlie lives in Northchapel in West Sussex. A tributary of the Arun runs through his garden. Charlie feels a relationship with rivers and thrives on watching flow and complexion. He is as interested in what happens below the surface as what happens above it; if the activity below the surface is contaminated, life is restricted and natureâ€™s struggle for health and wellbeing is curtailed. It is his ambition to see the Arun and Rother and Western Streams rapidly restored to health in line with the Water Framework Directive. He wants to inspire many people with a passion for ecology to contribute to this vision for our rivers.
