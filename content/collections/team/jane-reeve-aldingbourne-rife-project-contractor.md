Jane has a special interest in endangered mammal species and has been part of international teams researching primates in Indonesia and tigers in India.  The rapidly declining water vole has been the focus of Janeâ€™s attention for the last 14 years and this has allowed her to work locally and fall in love with all riparian mammals.  Jane enjoys liaising with farmers, landowners and communities to improve wetland areas and leading volunteer work parties to make action on the ground happen.  Happiest moments are in wellies in an unloved ditch and finding water vole signs or working with volunteers to breathe life into a new section of waterway.  It is very exciting to work with the ARRT team who have amazing skills, experience and passion for improving rivers.  Not very secret ambition is to work on a beaver introduction project locally!
