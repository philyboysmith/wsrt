Sian trained to be a classical violinist before pursuing a Diplomatic Service career that took her to Russia, Lithuania, The Netherlands, the Czech Republic, Austria and Serbia, including 12 years as an Ambassador.  As a diplomat she has been a professional advocate on environmental protection, climate change and greener energy, whilst supporting and working with conservation groups at home and abroad. Having grown up close to the River Itchen she has a lifelong love of rivers. With her family she has spent many hours walking, cycling, skiing or swimming in and along the Moskva, Rhine, Vltava and Danube and other continental European waterways.  Happiest in her wellies, since settling back for good into her East Hampshire family home she can be found out and about monitoring the water in the western Rother catchment and volunteering for other local environmental organisations.
