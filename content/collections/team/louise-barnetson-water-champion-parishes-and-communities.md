Louise has worked in the nature conservation sector for the past five years leading on practical habitat management, public and youth engagement, communications and citizen science. In her role as part of the Downs to the Sea project at Western Sussex Rivers Trust, Louise will be helping parish councils and communities to understand the importance of our riverscapes and how they can take action for their local water environment. With a passion and love of nature and wildlife, Louise is bringing a wealth of knowledge and skills to help inspire communities to help protect and enhance our special river habitats.
